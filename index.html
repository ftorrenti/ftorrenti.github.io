Welcome to my website! My name is Francisco Torrenti (Paco). I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Basel.

My research lies in the interplay of cosmology and particle physics. I study the implications of high-energy physics models in the dynamics of the early universe and their potential observational signatures. My main objective is to improve our understanding of the “primordial dark age”, meaning the intermediate stage between inflation and BBN.
