I am one of the main developers of **CosmoLattice**: a publicly available code for **lattice simulations of non-linear field dynamics in the early universe**.
The current version of the code can simulate scalar fields, Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields, and gravitational waves (tensor perturbations) in an expanding universe
(either self-consistently via the Friedmann equations or for a fixed equation of state).

The code is currently being used by different research groups around the globe. An updated list of papers that have used CosmoLattice can be found at <a href="http://https://cosmolattice.net/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

On September 2022, I was a main lecturer of the in-person **<a href="https://indico.ific.uv.es/event/6631/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CosmoLattice School 2022</a>**,
which we organized at Valencia (Spain). We had 50 participants from 12 different countries. An online school is planned for Summer 2023. Moreover, I have been a lecturer at the <a href="http://https://cosmolattice.net/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YETI 2022:
Phenomenology in the Sky'</a> PhD school at Durham U. (UK) on the topic of CosmoLattice.

I am also a co-author of the "The Art of Simulating the Early Universe" (JCAP'21), a ~100 page review/dissertation on real-time lattice techniques in an expanding universe, which constitutes the theoretical basis of the code.
Documentation also includes an extensive user manual (long version in arXiv: 2102.01031; summary paper: Comput.Phys.Commun. 283 (2023) 108586).
