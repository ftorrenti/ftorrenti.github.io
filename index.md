Welcome to my website! My name is Francisco Torrenti (akas Paco Torrenti), and I am currently 
a "Maria Zambrano" postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.uv.es/fisteo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U. Valencia</a> and <a href="http://ific.uv.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFIC</a>. 
Previously, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://particlesandcosmology.physik.unibas.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U. Basel</a>, 
and a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.ift.uam-csic.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFT, Madrid</a>.

My research is focused on the **interface between cosmology and fundamental physics**.
My main objective is to understand better what happened during the first instants of the universe,
and its connection with high energy physics models and potential observational signatures. 
I am also a main developer of **<a href="https://www.cosmolattice.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CosmoLattice</a>**, a code for lattice simulations of non-linear field dynamics in an expanding universe
